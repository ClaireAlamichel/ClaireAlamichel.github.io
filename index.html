I am a postdoctoral researcher at [INRIA - Rennes](https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-universite-rennes) in the team of Hélène Hivert. I am working on numerical methods for evolution in spatially structured population models.

I did my thesis at [LaMME](http://www.math-evry.cnrs.fr/welcome) at the Université d'Évry Paris-Saclay and at [DISMA](https://www.disma.polito.it/) at the Politecnico di Torino under the supervision of Nicolas Meunier and Luigi Preziosi. My thesis work focuses on the modelling of cell motility and the influence of the cell nucleus on it. My thesis manuscript is available [here](https://theses.hal.science/tel-04755731). My thesis was in part of a joint international thesis and the defence took place on 20 September 2024.

Before, I did [Mathématiques pour les Sciences du Vivant](https://sites.google.com/view/m2-msv/accueil) at Université Paris-Saclay in 2020.
