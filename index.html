I am a postdoctoral researcher at INRIA - Rennesin the team of Hélène Hivert. I am working on numerical methods for evolution in spatially structured population models.

I did my thesis at LaMME at the Université d'Évry Paris-Saclay and at DISMA at the Politecnico di Torino under the supervision of Nicolas Meunier and Luigi Preziosi. My thesis work focuses on the modelling of cell motility and the influence of the cell nucleus on it. My thesis was part of a joint international thesis and the defence took place on 20 September 2024.
